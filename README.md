# Ticket Processing System for Bodhi Meditation Toronto

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an automated **Ticket Processing System** for **Bodhi Meditation Toronto**, a public non-profit organization focused on promoting health and wellness through meditation. The goal of the system is to streamline the process of managing event registrations, ticket distribution, and customer information for free events hosted by the organization.

## Problem Statement

Bodhi Meditation Toronto's current ticketing process is inefficient and manual, relying on word-of-mouth promotion, in-person ticket distribution, and manual data entry. This leads to inconsistencies, delays, and difficulty in tracking ticket availability and customer information. The need for an automated solution is critical to enhance the efficiency of event management and provide a better experience for both customers and administrators.

## Key Features

- **Ticket Management**: Customers can cancel their tickets and administrators can update or delete event details.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Automatic notifications about ticket availability, cancellations, and event updates sent to both customers and administrators.
- **Integrated Database**: Centralized system for managing event details, customer information, and attendance data.
- **Event Updates**: Administrators can manage all event details, including adding, updating, or removing events.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MySQL (or any relational database for event and customer data)
- **Email Notification**: SMTP, Nodemailer (for sending confirmation and cancellation emails)
